                        requests or requirements relating to your use of the Site or information provided to or gathered
                        by Southwest Florida USA Dance with respect to such use. If any part of this agreement is
                        determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited
                        to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or
                        unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most
                        closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the agreement shall
                        continue in effect.

                        or written, between the user and Southwest Florida USA Dance with respect to the Site. A printed
                        version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in
